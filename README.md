The main objective of this project is to understand return rates and identify potential causes for returned orders in a retail dataset used various Tableau visualizations to explore different aspects of the data. The dataset used is from Tableau Public: Saving Super Store. 

I used a series of Tableau Visualizations to explore the data. 
A scatterplot showing the correlation between total sales and total returns by product subcategory. 
A bar chart showing the return rate by product category and customer. 
A map showing the return rate by a geographic measure. 
The return rate by a measure of time to explore seasonal effects.
Lastly, two different composite charts showing the return rate for a mix of multiple factors.
